memcached Cookbook
==================
The actual cookbook isn't much to hang from the tree, this project is just a skeleton one to use for testing and training of the toolset around Chef development.

This project is set up to work with Vagrant, kitchen, Strainer, serverspec and rspec.

To run the test suite, do:

```
bundle install
bundle exec strainer test
```
